# ticTacToeGame
Tic-Tac-Toe game feature that could be added: Add a “Hint” button.

The hint button would tell the current user a next move.  It could display (in a different color) a next X or O that would/could be a winner.

Would have to know which user was current and could get complicated. 

There may be several answers, especially early in the game.
